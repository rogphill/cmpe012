Lab 2: Introduction to Logic with MML
01D with Carlos Ramirez

To make my own 7-segment display from Part B, I think I would have to use logical gates. The four switches would have to logically combine to fill in the seven segments on the display such that they produce the 15 different hexadecimal numbers (0, 1, ... , D, F).

I suspect, with some background knowledge from my previous courses, that the random number generator is a combination of "seeding" from the internal clock and some mathematical formulas to constrain and manipulate that seed into a desired random number. In truth, I'm not quite sure how the random number generator works, however. 

I don't think things can ever truly be "random" on a computer since they are built using logic gates almost with the intention of building randomness out of the machine. I would think that if you have a seed, you would be able to replicate the "randomness." However, I am ultimately not sure and am eager to learn more about it, hopefully this quarter.
